Information
-----------
This program is inspired by an older 16-bit piece of software called PathMinder.

Being a 16-bit program, PathMinder cannot be used on 32-bit or 64-bit windows versions.  Thus this program was written in order to bring the nice ideas of this program into modern Windows versions.  The program is written in wxpython, so it can just as easily be used on OSX or linux, with native appearance in each platform.

It allows for applications to be set up that can be easily accessed with two keystrokes - for instance A, S could be configured to open the selected file in SciTE (my text editor of choice).
